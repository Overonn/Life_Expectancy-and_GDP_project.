# Life_Expectancy-and_GDP_project.
For this project, we will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

Focusing Questions:

- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- What is the average life expactancy in these nations?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

The dataset provided has the following columns of data:

- Country - nation
- Year - the year for the observation
- Life expectancy at birth (years) - life expectancy value in years
- GDP - Gross Domestic Product in U.S. dollars
